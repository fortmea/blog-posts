After a long break, i'm back with a new hobby!

---------

[More details](https://github.com/fortmea/arduino-drums)

So far, the most basic functions are working properly. For example: I can control the 4 initial voices planned (kick, snare, open hat, hi hat), I can save and load presets, I can control BPM and pitch.

----

Future plans for the project

* Develop a custom PCB to create a portable version of the project
* Increase storage capacity, storing all settings (not just drum beat presets)
* Add more sample options

See you soon!
