summary: "I decided to transfer my personal page to another platform."
---

### Why?

There were several reasons for this, including:

1. The platform I used to host my previous blog (Fleek) had some problems and the website was sometimes inaccessible;
2. It was a custom-made website with a messy codebase (since I built it over many years, with different mentalities and approaches each time);
3. In addition, the technology used (NextJS) ~~was no longer very interesting~~ and the build times were getting bigger and bigger;
4. No more time left, brother.

### What's the replacement and how did I choose it?

I chose Hugo with the PaperMod theme. Apart from being extremely fast (see image), it's also incredibly easy to configure, reuse, and expand the page using this technology.
<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center; text-align: center;">
    <img src="/posts/images/iamspeed.png" alt="alt">
    <p><em>Exactly 118ms to generate the site!</em></p>
</div>

### Previous posts and resources that were previously hosted here

Some content that was previously hosted on this website has been restored (licensing for my app and some articles), but part of these articles no longer align with the new website.

I don't plan to update the old articles, so it's essential to keep in mind the change in the website when reading them.


### Future plans

I plan to update more frequently about other projects and changes on this blog. I also intend to use it as a portfolio at some point.
